# RS school projects

Below are some of my projects that I did on my own during my studies at [RS School(stage 0)](https://rs.school/):

-  ðŸ“– &nbsp;[Library](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/splitcode-JSFEPRESCHOOL2023Q2/library/) - A website with pop-up windows and the possibility of registration.
-  ðŸŽ² &nbsp;[2048 Game](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/splitcode-JSFEPRESCHOOL2023Q2/random-game/) - Ð¡lassic puzzle game. Join the tiles and get to 2048!
-  ðŸ–¼ &nbsp;[API Image Gallery](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/splitcode-JSFEPRESCHOOL2023Q2/image-galery/) - An application that displays photos received from the API. When you enter a search query, the photos that are displayed in the application change according to the query.
